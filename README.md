# What It Does
- Modernizes the digital shopping experience, leveraging agumented reality (AR) and machine learning (ML) techniques to bring digital shopping to your physical world




# Inspiration
As brick and mortar stores close across the country, beaten by online retail giants like Amazon and Walmart, shoppers are forced to purchase online. While digital shopping can be more convient and accessible to millions, consumers miss out on the interaction with products in their own physical environment and finding products can be tough when you do not know what to search for. This is why we have created *NAME*, a web app avaliable on desktop, iOS, and Android that uses augmented reality, machine learning, blockchain, and crypto to modernize shopping - making a new interplay between the physical world and digital shopping platforms.


# How We Built It
1. 3D models/AR (using Echo3D)
2. Authentication (using Firebase)
3. Machine Learning (using Tensorflow.JS)
4. Crypto Payments (using Crypto.js)
5. private blockchain acting as a Quality control ledger for products

React JS
